# Electronix--NextJS

Electronix--NextJS is an improved version of my Bachelor's project, which was initially built using React and Flask. In this project, I made several major changes: Flask was replaced with Express, and React was replaced with Next.js, enhancing the performance and functionality of the application.

### Changes and New Features

- **Google Authentication**: Added authentication via Google, making it easier for users to sign up and log in.
- **Profile Pictures**: Users who authenticate via Google will have a personalized profile picture. Users who choose classic authentication (email and password) will have a default profile picture. The ability to change the profile picture might be added in the future.
- **Next.js**: Using Next.js instead of React provides advantages in terms of server-side rendering and application performance.

### Limitations

- Unfortunately, this version no longer includes the recommendation system based on user preferences and shopping history. It might be reintroduced in a future version.

This project represents a step forward from the previous version, offering a modernized architecture and a better user experience.
